description: Do you think there is the same type of me wandering?

Once I took a long walk with a friend around the school, she asked, *I cannot understand you even a touch, you're of such puzzles*. There I answered, *You know that world's a big madhouse, in which you never hope who'll you meet*. She noded slightly.

Frenquently would I find how conflict myself is, in which case everyone seems so ordinary as if they're born with such *common* sense towards life and the society.

But when dig into one's heart continually and things change. I know that one's suffering from lovelorn the moment he exclaims the fun of being a bachelor, and I know one's sad about himself while he pretend to pleasing us in a ridiculous way.

'Cuz seldom may we prospect one's mind inside as surviving the world has been difficult.

We encountered, then made acquaintance the next step, while we might need to chat online sometimes that's not so formal to have a positive impression about each other, so how about then?
